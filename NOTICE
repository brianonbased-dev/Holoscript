COMMERCIAL ECOSYSTEM
================================================================================

HoloScript is a fully open-source spatial computing language. The following
commercial products and services are built on top of HoloScript and are
separately licensed:

  Hololand (https://github.com/brianonbased-dev/Hololand)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The VR/AR platform and deployment infrastructure for HoloScript applications.
  Provides cloud anchors, multiplayer relay, asset CDN, VPS localization,
  digital twin sync, marketplace, and hosted deployment services.
  Hololand platform services are proprietary and commercially licensed.

  Infinity Assistant (https://infinityassistant.io)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  AI-powered building, code generation, and deployment assistant for HoloScript.
  Provides LLM-driven spatial scene generation, natural language to .holo
  compilation, agent orchestration, and accessibility AI services.
  Infinity Assistant services are proprietary and commercially licensed.

================================================================================
OPEN-SOURCE COMMITMENT
================================================================================

The following components are and will remain MIT-licensed open source:

  - HoloScript language specification (.holo and .hsplus formats)
  - Parser and AST (HoloScriptPlusParser, HoloComposition types)
  - All 139 trait definitions and handler implementations
  - All 8 compiler targets (R3F, Unity, Godot, visionOS, WebGPU, Babylon,
    Android XR, OpenXR)
  - Core LSP service (embedded in @holoscript/core)
  - VS Code extension
  - CLI tools (holoscript, holoscript-format, holoscript-lint)
  - Standard library (@holoscript/std)
  - Runtime (@holoscript/runtime)
  - Spatial audio, accessibility, gestures, haptics, IK, LOD, PCG,
    portals, physics-joints, voice, test packages

The following components use the Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2):

  You may use, copy, and modify these packages. You may NOT provide them
  as a managed/hosted service to third parties. See the Elastic License 2.0
  for full terms.

  - @holoscript/lsp — Standalone Language Server Protocol server.
    (The core LSP engine embedded in @holoscript/core remains MIT.)
  - @holoscript/mcp-server — Model Context Protocol server for AI agents.

  The following ELv2 packages have been migrated to the Hololand platform repo:

  - @holoscript/network → @hololand/network
  - @holoscript/multiplayer → @hololand/multiplayer
  - @holoscript/state-sync → @hololand/state-sync
  - @holoscript/streaming → @hololand/streaming

Traits that reference cloud services (e.g., @shared_anchor, @co_located,
@remote_presence, @persistent_anchor with storage:'cloud', @vps, @marketplace)
define open interfaces. The backend infrastructure that fulfills these
interfaces is provided by Hololand's commercial services.

Traits that reference AI capabilities (e.g., @llm_agent, @dialogue with LLM
mode, @accessible auto-generation) define open interfaces. The AI inference
that powers these capabilities is provided by Infinity Assistant's commercial
services.
